Hiring Manager
HCA Healthcare

Dear Hiring Manager,

As a digital transformation leader who has implemented AI-driven clinical decision 
support and enterprise-wide HealthTech solutions across hospital networks, I was 
immediately drawn to HCA's scale and commitment to transforming patient care through 
technology.

At Saudi German Hospital Group (TopMed), I am leading digital transformation 
initiatives that deliver measurable results:
• Implementing Health Catalyst AI platform and enterprise data warehouse for 
  real-time analytics across 10+ hospitals
• Deploying AI-driven Clinical Decision Support tools, improving patient outcomes
• Leading telemedicine and virtual care platform initiatives serving 500K+ patients
• Managing $25M+ P&L and cross-functional teams of 50+ across 4 countries
• Ensuring JCI, HIMSS, and HIPAA compliance across all digital health initiatives

My previous experience leading digital transformation at El Araby Group (SAP S/4HANA 
implementation) and scaling digital operations at Talabat (30K to 7M daily orders) 
provides the enterprise-scale expertise to drive results at HCA's magnitude.

I bring expertise in:
• Digital transformation strategy and execution in healthcare
• AI/ML implementation (Health Catalyst, predictive analytics, clinical decision support)
• Large-scale healthcare operations ($25M+ P&L, 500K+ patients)
• EMR/EHR systems and healthcare compliance (HIPAA, JCI, HIMSS)
• Building and leading high-performing, cross-functional teams

What distinguishes my background is the proven ability to lead digital transformation 
initiatives that combine technical innovation with operational excellence—from 
enterprise ERP implementations to AI-powered clinical solutions.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring this digital transformation expertise 
to HCA Healthcare's mission. I am available for a conversation at your convenience.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Ahmed Nasr, MBA (In Progress), PMP
Digital Transformation Leader & PMO Director
