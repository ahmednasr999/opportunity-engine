Hiring Manager
HCA Healthcare

Dear Hiring Manager,

As a healthcare operations leader who has implemented AI-driven clinical decision 
support across hospital networks using Health Catalyst and machine learning, I was 
immediately drawn to HCA's scale and commitment to transforming patient care through 
technology.

At Saudi German Hospital Group (TopMed), I have driven measurable improvements:
• Implemented Health Catalyst AI platform, improving patient outcomes by 23%
• Reduced operational processing time by 40% using AI/ML and predictive analytics
• Delivered 25% efficiency gains and $2.3M annual cost reduction
• Manage $25M+ P&L and lead 50+ professionals across 4 countries

My experience at Intel and Microsoft provided the enterprise-scale technical 
foundation, while my MBA and PMP credentials ensure I can translate clinical needs 
into executable strategies. I bring expertise in:

• AI/ML strategy and implementation (TensorFlow, Python, Health Catalyst)
• Large-scale healthcare operations ($25M+ P&L, 500K+ patients)
• EMR/EHR systems (Epic/Cerner) and HIPAA compliance
• Building and leading high-performing, cross-functional teams
• Change management and stakeholder alignment

What distinguishes my background is the combination of deep technical expertise 
(Intel, Microsoft) with hands-on healthcare operations leadership (SGH). I understand 
both the clinical mission and the operational reality of delivering care at scale.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring this expertise to HCA Healthcare's 
mission of transforming patient care. I am available for a conversation at your 
convenience and can be reached at the contact information above.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Ahmed Nasr, MBA, PMP
PMO & AI Automation Leader
