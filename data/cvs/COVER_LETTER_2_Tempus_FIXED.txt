Hiring Manager
Tempus

Dear Hiring Manager,

The intersection of AI and precision medicine represents the future of healthcare, 
and Tempus is clearly leading that transformation. My experience implementing Health 
Catalyst AI solutions across 10+ hospitals using machine learning and predictive 
analytics has prepared me to contribute immediately to your mission.

At Saudi German Hospital Group, I have driven results that align with Tempus's goals:
• Implemented AI-driven clinical decision support, improving patient outcomes by 23%
• Scaled operations from pilot to enterprise deployment serving 500K+ patients
• Manage $25M+ P&L and lead product operations with team of 50+
• Delivered $2.3M annual cost reductions through operational excellence

My background offers Tempus:
• AI/ML product development (TensorFlow, Python, Health Catalyst)
• Scaling from research to commercial deployment
• Healthcare operations and regulatory compliance (HIPAA)
• Enterprise experience (Intel, Microsoft) with startup agility
• P&L management and cross-functional team leadership

What distinguishes my background is the rare combination of enterprise-scale 
experience (Intel, Microsoft) with hands-on healthcare AI implementation (SGH). I 
understand how to build products that work technically and drive real clinical value.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Tempus's mission of personalizing 
cancer care through AI. I can be reached at ahmednasr999@gmail.com or +971 50 281 4490.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Ahmed Nasr, MBA, PMP
PMO & AI Automation Leader
