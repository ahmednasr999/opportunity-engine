Hiring Manager
Teladoc Health

Dear Hiring Manager,

Virtual care isn't the future—it's the present. Having led digital health 
transformation and telemedicine initiatives at Saudi German Hospital Group, I 
understand both the technical infrastructure and operational complexity required 
to deliver care at scale to millions of patients.

At SGH (TopMed), I have driven measurable improvements in digital health:
• Implemented AI-driven telemedicine and clinical decision support systems
• Reduced operational processing time by 40% using AI/ML and predictive analytics
• Manage $25M+ P&L across regional hospitals serving 500K+ patients
• Delivered 25% efficiency gains through virtual care and operational excellence
• Ensure HIPAA compliance and secure technology infrastructure

My experience at Intel and Microsoft provided the enterprise-scale foundation 
to build platforms serving 90M+ users, while my current role at SGH has given me 
hands-on healthcare operations expertise. I bring:

• Telemedicine and virtual care platform leadership
• AI/ML implementation (Health Catalyst, TensorFlow, Python)
• Large-scale operations ($25M+ P&L, multi-region teams)
• HIPAA compliance and healthcare regulatory expertise
• Proven ability to scale digital health initiatives

The opportunity to bring this expertise to Teladoc's mission of making virtual 
care accessible to 90M+ patients genuinely excites me. I am available for a 
conversation at your convenience.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Ahmed Nasr, MBA, PMP
PMO & AI Automation Leader
