Hiring Manager
Teladoc Health

Dear Hiring Manager,

Virtual care isn't the future—it's the present. As a digital transformation 
leader who has implemented telemedicine platforms, virtual care solutions, and 
digital patient engagement systems at Saudi German Hospital Group, I understand 
both the technical infrastructure and operational complexity required to deliver 
care at scale to millions of patients.

At SGH (TopMed), I am leading digital transformation and virtual care initiatives:
• Implementing comprehensive telemedicine platforms and virtual care solutions 
  serving 500K+ patients annually
• Leading digital patient engagement through mobile apps, portals, and 
  remote monitoring systems
• Deploying Health Catalyst AI platform and clinical decision support for 
  virtual care delivery
• Managing $25M+ P&L for digital transformation and health technology programs
• Building cross-functional teams of 50+ across 4 countries
• Ensuring HIPAA compliance and healthcare regulations across all digital platforms

My experience scaling digital operations at Talabat (30K to 7M daily orders) and 
leading digital transformation at El Araby Group (SAP S/4HANA, hospital ERP) 
provides the enterprise-scale foundation to build platforms serving millions.

I bring:
• Digital transformation leadership in telemedicine and virtual care
• AI/ML implementation for remote patient monitoring and clinical decision support
• Large-scale digital health operations ($25M+ P&L, multi-region teams)
• Patient engagement platform development and deployment
• HIPAA compliance and healthcare regulatory expertise
• Proven ability to scale digital health initiatives

The opportunity to bring this digital transformation expertise to Teladoc's 
mission of making virtual care accessible to 90M+ patients genuinely excites me.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Ahmed Nasr, MBA (In Progress), PMP
Digital Transformation Leader & PMO Director
