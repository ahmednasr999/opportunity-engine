AI in healthcare isn't about replacing doctors—it's about amplifying their impact.

After implementing AI automation across 15+ hospitals, I've noticed a pattern:

The organizations that succeed don't have the best technology.

They have the best change management.

✓ Data quality > Data quantity.

Clean data from 100 patients beats messy data from 100,000.
✓ Start with clinical champions, not technology.

Find the doctors who stay up late reading about AI. They'll drag the organization forward.
✓ Integration beats innovation.

A mediocre system that works with existing workflows beats a brilliant system that requires disruption.

The future of healthcare is being written now. Be part of writing it.
